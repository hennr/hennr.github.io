Hi, my name is Jan-Hendrik Peters but most people will know me as Henner.
I am a software developer from Berlin, Germany working at <a href="http://www.idealo.de/">idealo</a> at the moment.


I enjoy rowing, climbing and of course writing software or help maintaining it.

Below you will find some things I did so far.

#### [blog](/posts)
Mostly technical notes for myself to remember but probably they will help someone else, too. 

#### [marabou audio tagger](https://github.com/hennr/marabou)

I wrote a cross-platform audio tagger in Java which is similar to mp3tag.

#### [mp3agic](https://github.com/mpatric/mp3agic)

I co-maintain this Java ID3 tagging library.

#### [wine app maintenance](https://www.winehq.org/)

I maintain some apps for wine; building and testing new releases, regression testing, bug reports.
If you use wine, you should consider doing the same!

#### [debian package for flare](https://packages.debian.org/sid/flare)

I initially packaged [flare](http://flarerpg.org/) (a Diablo like game) for debian and maintained it for a while.

#### [pdfreaders.org](https://pdfreaders.org)

I was one of the initiators of this FSFE campaign which we started to push free PDF readers and open standards.
